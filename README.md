# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

**Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project**  
Hosted by: Consulting & Analytics Club × Pathway

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban parking lots face inefficient use when prices are static. This project builds a dynamic pricing engine using real-time data and ML-inspired logic to make smarter pricing decisions for urban parking lots.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib / Bokeh (for visualization)
- Pathway (for real-time simulation)
- GitHub (version control & sharing)

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

### 🔹 Model 1: Baseline Linear Model
- Based on occupancy and capacity.
- Simple linear price increase.

### 🔹 Model 2: Demand-Based Model
- Uses: Occupancy, QueueLength, Traffic, VehicleType, IsSpecialDay
- Computes a weighted demand function.
- Normalizes demand and adjusts pricing smoothly.

### 🔹 Model 3 (Optional): Competitive Pricing
- To be implemented. Adjusts price based on nearby parking lot pricing and proximity.
